----

Image creation, curation, and sharing incentivization network.

## Earn Rewards

CCCoin automatically rewards those who positively contribute in any of a wide variety of ways,

1. Submit your original images - Submit images that get sufficient votes, and you make money. Submit images that don't get sufficient votes, you lose money.
2. Vote on images - Vote on images that receive sufficient subsequent votes after your vote, and you make money. Vote on images that don't receive sufficient subsequent votes, you lose money.
3. Running a web node - Develop custom anti-spam mechanisms, then provide hosting and front Gas fees to users who subsequently earn sufficient money through any of the actions above, and you make money. Front these resources to users who lose money, and you lose money.
4. Funding development of more effective web nodes - Fund the resource fees for web nodes that are fronting resources to users in a net profitable way, and receive a share of the net rewards. Fund web nodes that are not, incur net a loss. Web nodes are currently responsible for implementing this.
5. Buying the CCCoin token - Fund the advancement of the entire CCCoin ecosystem of resource providers by supporting the price of CCCoin. Feel the rewards of knowing you're contributing to creative good!

## Features

- Zero fees - unlike micro-tipping platforms, CCCoin aims to be completely free to use for content viewers, voters, and submitters. Funds to front the necessary fees are funded by web node operators or those who invest in them.
- Trustless - meritocratic incentives system allowing bad actors to be automatically replaced by good actors.
- Permissionless - anyone can contribute without permission, by submitting directly to the blockchain, though those who make negative contributions will likely lose money.
- Fault tolerant - resource providers that disappear or go rogue can be replaced in a meritocratic, permissionless, automated way.
- Distributed Computation - See trustlessness and fault tolerance.
- Distributed Control - See trustlessness.
- Decentralized Control - See trustlessness.

*Distributed - hiring a thousand guards to protect you with the hope that more is simply better. Trustless - ensuring there's always geater monetary benefit to your guards for them to protect you, rather than to accept bribes to harm you.*

## Technical

- Mediachain - Used for metadata storage, search and organization.
- Ethereum - Used for ERC20 Token and resolving concurrency conflicts into a single universal transaction ordering.
- Custom Consensus and Incentives Core - Custom blockchain consensus and incentives mechanisms that build upon the above foundations.

## Status

Initial implementation of the above properties is complete. Future planned work involves evolving from a single rewards node, which can be fired at any time and replaced via a hard fork performed by the users of the network, if they collectively choose to do so, toward a softer voting mechanism which will instead allow users to continually vote to elect a consortium of operators for rewards nodes. Further streamlining third party funding of web nodes is also planned.
