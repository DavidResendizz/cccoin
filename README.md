**CCCoin** - Image creation, curation, and sharing incentivization network.

## Rewards

CCCoin automatically rewards those who positively contribute in any of a wide variety of ways,

1. **Submit your images** - Submit images that get sufficient votes, and you make money. Submit images that don't get sufficient votes, you lose money.
2. **Vote on images** - Vote on images that receive sufficient subsequent votes after your vote, and you make money. Vote on images that don't receive sufficient subsequent votes, you lose money.
3. **Run a web node** - Run a web node, optionally develop custom anti-spam controls, provide hosting to and front Gas fees to end users. If the end users your node chooses to host subsequently earn sufficient money through any of the actions above, you make money. Front these resources to users who lose money, and you lose money.
4. **Fund other's web nodes** - Fund the resource fees for web nodes that are fronting resources to users in a net profitable way, and receive a share of the net rewards. Fund web nodes that are not, incur net a loss. Web nodes are currently responsible for implementing this.
5. **Run rewards node** - Properly carry out the computations for distributing rewards, and you make money. Distribute rewards poorly, you get forked and cut out.
6. **Buy the CCCoin token** - Fund the advancement of the entire CCCoin ecosystem of resource providers by supporting the price of CCCoin. Feel the rewards of knowing you're contributing to creative good!

## Properties

- **Trustless** - meritocratic incentives system allowing bad actors to be automatically replaced by good actors.
- **Permissionless** - anyone can contribute without permission, by submitting directly to the blockchain, though those who make negative contributions will likely lose money.
- **Zero fee** - unlike micro-tipping platforms, CCCoin aims to be completely free to use for content viewers, voters, and submitters. Funds to front the necessary fees are funded by web node operators or those who invest in them.
- **Fault tolerant** - resource providers that disappear or go rogue can be replaced in a meritocratic, permissionless, automated way.
- **Distributed Computation**, **Distributed Control**, **Decentralized Control** - See trustlessness and fault tolerance.

*Distributed - hiring a thousand guards to protect you with the hope that more is simply better. Trustless - ensuring there's always geater monetary benefit to your guards for them to protect you, rather than to accept bribes to harm you.*

## Technologies

- **Mediachain** - Metadata storage, metadata search, and metadata organization.
- **Ethereum** - ERC20 Token and resolving concurrency conflicts into a single universal transaction ordering.
- **CCCoin Core** - Custom blockchain consensus and incentives mechanisms that build upon the above foundations.

## Status

Upcoming development includes evolving from a single rewards node operating at a time, which can be fired and replaced at any time via a hard fork performed by the users of the network if they collectively choose to do so, toward a softer voting mechanism which will instead allow users to continually vote to elect a consortium of operators for rewards nodes. Further streamlining third party funding of web nodes is also planned.
